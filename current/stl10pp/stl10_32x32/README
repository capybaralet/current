The .pkl files in this directory may be opened in python using
cPickle, pickle, or pylearn2.serial.load. They contain pylearn2
Dataset objects defining the STL-10 dataset, but downsampled to
size 32x32 and translated to lie in [-127.5, 127.5 ].

They were created with the pylearn2 script make_downsampled_stl10.py

All other files in this directory, including this README, were
created by the same script and are necessary for the other files
to function correctly.
