# This is a script to train Denoising Autoenconders with a range of hyper-parameters
# on patch-pair data extracted from images, save the trained models, and plot example 
# input/reconstruction pairs.
# 
# Currently, we are using CIFAR-10 for the datset, but we will change this to using face data.
#
# This script will also likely be broken up into several scripts for modularity once I have it 
# running smoothly.
